My solutions to some Google Code Jam problems.
Solutions for problems from any given round shall not be uploaded while the round lasts.
Since the time to solve all the problems in round 1 is fairly limited, I treat it as an exercise in 'working under the time pressure' and as a way of showing you that under time pressure I can still produce working code and make meaningful decisions (such as whether to pursue a small-only solution or a full solution to a particular problem).
